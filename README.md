# My Portfolio

This is the legacy version of my portfolio built using React and Javascript. Through the advice of one of my coding mentors I have rebuilt the code using Next.Js and Typescript. You can find the github repo here: https://github.com/WattBowers/portfolio 

You can also find the live site to my page here: https://jackson-watt-bowers-172z2raxh-wattbowers.vercel.app/
