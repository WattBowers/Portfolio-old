# My Portfolio

This is the repository for my coding portfolio. Feel free to clone the repository and use the underlying code. 

## Tech

This project is built using React.js, it is hosted using Heroku. Here is the link to the live site: https://jackson-watt-bowers.herokuapp.com/#

## Take aways

My innitial thought when creating this site is for it to be a hub for my personal projects to live, and to be something to send to those who might be interested in my work.
